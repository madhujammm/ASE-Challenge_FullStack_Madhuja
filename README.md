# ASE-Challenge_FullStack_Madhuja
Hey, I’m Madhuja Mungase 👩‍💻, a CS undergrad who loves learning fast &amp; shipping real stuff. For the ASE Challenge by Verto, I built a fullstack Employee Management App, end-to-end project with frontend, backend &amp; DB. Focused on smooth flow, real-world vibe &amp; solid code.
